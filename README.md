# event-manager-form-tags
Add Tags to the Add Event Form for the WordPress Event Manager Plugin https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-manager/

This plugin allows Event Tags to be added to Events from the Frontend Event Form.
NOTE: Tags need to be enabled in the plugin settings for this to work.

I am not a programmer but asked ChatGPT to code a solution.
Test this plugin on a staging environment first. You use this plugin at your own risk.
